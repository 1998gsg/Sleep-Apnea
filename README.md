# Sleep-Apnea

The proposed design model focuses on age variants and face landmark variations to detect
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Facial photographs are collected from subjects at different
lightings, and a MATLAB model is developed using deep learning neural networks. Key features
related to OSA, such as distances between eyes, nose, and cheek, are extracted using a
convolutional neural network. The model predicts the presence of OSA in patients based on these
features, achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall rates.
